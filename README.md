# 📅 Event Management System (DSA Project in C)

This project is a simple **Event Management System** implemented in **C language** using **Singly Linked Lists** and **Queue data structures**. Designed as a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) semester project, it simulates event planning, cost estimation, and queue processing based on user-defined events.

Sample Input and Output uploaded in the repository


## 📌 Features

- 📋 Add new events with name, date, and base cost
- 🏷️ Add multiple custom attributes to each event (e.g., decoration, catering, etc.)
- ❗ Detect and warn about date clashes
- 💸 Estimate total event cost (base + all attributes)
- 🧾 View all events and their details
- 🔄 Queue-based processing of events (FIFO)
- 🧹 Graceful memory deallocation to avoid leaks


## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Singly Linked Lists
- Queues (custom implementation)
- Structs and Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Menu-driven programming
- String handling and pointer management


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology     |
|---------------|----------------|
| Language      | C              |

# ♻️ Future Enhancements
Add file I/O support to save/load event data

Add login-based access for admin/students

Use doubly linked list for reverse traversal

GUI-based frontend using GTK or C++ Qt
