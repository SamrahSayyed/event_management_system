# Event Management System (DSA Project in C)

This project is a simple **Event Management System** implemented in **C language** using **Singly Linked Lists** and **Queue data structures**. It simulates event planning, cost estimation, and queue processing based on user-defined events.

Sample Input and Output uploaded in the repository


##  Features

-  Add new events with name, date, and base cost
- 🏷 Add multiple custom attributes to each event (e.g., decoration, catering, etc.)
-  Detect and warn about date clashes
-  Estimate total event cost (base + all attributes)
-  View all events and their details
-  Queue-based processing of events (FIFO)
-  Graceful memory deallocation to avoid leaks


##  Concepts Used

- Singly Linked Lists
- Queues (custom implementation)
- Structs and Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Menu-driven programming
- String handling and pointer management


##  Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology     |
|---------------|----------------|
| Language      | C              |

#  Future Enhancements
Add file I/O support to save/load event data

Add sorting options (by date, cost, name)

Add login-based access for admin/students

Use doubly linked list for reverse traversal

GUI-based frontend using GTK or C++ Qt
